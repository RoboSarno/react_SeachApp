# react_SearchApp

This application is a simple first attempt at messing with React. 

## What it is...

This application is a search list that can find a user that exists in an array of users.  The information it can search through is a name, email and along with that a photo is also a element of that user.  More can be added but for simplicity just those three elements exists.
